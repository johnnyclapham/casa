WARNING - Please use the exploit APK to manually test for TapJacking until we have a chance to complete this module. The impact should be verified manually anyway, so have fun...
ISSUES - ADB EXPLOIT COMMANDS
INFO - Until we perfect this, for manually testing, run the following command to see all the options and their meanings: adb shell am. Make sure to update qark frequently to get all the enhancements! You'll also find some good examples here: http://xgouchet.fr/android/index.php?article42/launch-intents-using-adb
INFO - Support for other component types and dynamically adding extras is in the works, please check for updates
